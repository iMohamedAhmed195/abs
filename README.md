# Project Setup Guide

This project is built using a base Flutter architecture with clean separation of concerns following Clean Architecture principles.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To create a new project based on this structure:

1. Clone this repository or copy the base project files.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

These steps ensure all packages are properly installed before running the app.

> **Note:** If you add or update any packages, you must repeat the above commands to ensure everything is up-to-date.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

This project follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern. Each feature is divided into the following layers:

* `data` â€“ Handles data sources and models.
* `domain` â€“ Contains business logic and use cases.
* `presentation` â€“ Manages the UI and state.

### ðŸ“‚ Presentation Layer Structure

Each feature's `presentation` folder includes:

* **`screen/`** â€“ The main UI screens.
* **`widget/`** â€“ Contains smaller UI components (stateless/stateful) extracted from screens.
* **`manager/`** â€“ Handles state management using **Cubit**.

This modular structure ensures scalability, maintainability, and clean code separation.

## âœ… Notes

* Always run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get` after adding or updating packages.
* Follow the feature-based structure strictly for consistency and readability.
* To build the APK for release, run the following command:

```bash
flutter build apk
```
